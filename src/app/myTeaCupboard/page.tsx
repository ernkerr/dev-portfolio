            My Tea Cupboard is intentionally minimal and highlights a
            fundamental approach
            <br />
            to web development, focusing on core web technologies before
            introducing more
            <br /> complex tools like frameworks or databases.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>HTML</strong> Provides the fundamental structure and content
            of the webpage.
            <strong> CSS</strong> Manages the
            <br /> styling and visual presentation, including layout, colors,
            and fonts.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Vanilla JavaScript </strong> Handles all the interactive
            elements and application logic without the
            <br />
            use of external libraries or frameworks.
            <br />
            This includes features like adding, editing, and deleting tea
            entries.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Local Storage</strong> is a browser feature that allows
            websites to
            <br />
            store key-value pairs locally on a user&apos;s machine.
            <br />
            It&apos;s used here to save the list of teas so they persist even
            after the user closes the browser.
            <br />
            <br />I chose <strong>GitHub Pages </strong>
            A free hosting service from GitHub that serves static websites
            directly <br /> from a repository. It&apos;s perfect for projects
            like this that don&apos;t require server-side processing.
